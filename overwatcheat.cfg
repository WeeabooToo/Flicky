# The virtual key code key which activates the aim bot when held.
# When using flicking mode, do not set this to left mouse button.
# Effect: Changes which key must be held for the aimbot logic to run; pick an unused key so you do not fire the bot accidentally.
aim_key=6

# 0 = TRACKING: for tracking (e.g. Soldier, Tracer)
# 1 = FLICKING: for flicking (e.g. McCree, Ashe)
# Effect: Switches between smooth tracking and snappy flick mode, altering how motion and shooting heuristics are applied.
aim_mode=1

# Your in-game sensitivity.
# Effect: Must match your Overwatch sensitivity so mouse delta scaling produces accurate aim corrections.
sensitivity=2.4

# The number of frames per second to capture the game at.
# The higher this is, the faster frames will be sampled and scanned.
# Essentially, the positional accuracy will increase by raising FPS.
#
# The the best way to reduce CPU usage is to lower this.
# Effect: Directly trades CPU load for detection responsiveness; higher values sample more often but use more CPU.
fps=488

# The number of milliseconds each aim duration should last.
#
# This essentially lets you control how fast the aim bot will snap,
# with lower values resulting in a more snappy and fast aim. #Main Speed 86
# Effect: Shorter durations make aim corrections finish quicker, while longer durations stretch motions for smoother but slower snaps.
aim_duration_millis=.5

# The base float to use to calculate sleep time multiplier.
#
# The higher this is, the more smooth and less sticky the aiming will be. #Second Speed
# Effect: Raises the lower bound on per-frame sleep so movements feel smoother but slightly less responsive.
aim_duration_multiplier_base=1

# The maximum float value to use as a sleep time multiplier.
#
# Use this to create an upper limit based off aim duration.
# i.e., if aim_duration_millis is 3, and aim_duration_multiplier_max is 2.0,
# the maximum sleep time would be 6 milliseconds.
#
# For perfectly consistent sleep time, set this to 1.0
# Effect: Caps how slow the sleeper can become; higher caps allow more smoothing headroom, lower caps keep motion timing tighter.
aim_duration_multiplier_max=1

# Proportional aim gain and smoothing factor (0..1).
# Effect: aim_kp scales how aggressively the bot reacts to error; aim_alpha blends motion to dampen jitter. Adjust together to control responsiveness.
aim_kp=0.5
aim_alpha=0.5

# The maximum number of pixels to move per frame scan.
#
# In flick mode, consider increasing this dramatically, 10+
# Effect: Hard limits per-frame cursor jumps; raising allows larger leaps, lowering constrains overshoot but may slow large corrections.
aim_max_move_pixels=8

# The percentage of how much random jitter can be introduced.
#
# In essence, the higher you make this, the more the possibility that the aim position is off,
# resulting in a more human-like aim.
#
# To completely disable (for perfect accuracy), set to 0.
# Effect: Adds randomized offset to mimic human imperfection; increases stealthiness at the cost of precision.
aim_jitter_percent=0

# The sizes in pixels for the minimum required target width and height.
#
# Lowering this value may help with long-range accuracy, but at the cost of more
# false positives should there be any pixels that match the color set.
# Effect: Acts as a noise filter; higher values ignore tiny color specks, lower values pick up smaller or distant targets more readily.
aim_min_target_width=1
aim_min_target_height=1

# Overwatcheat scans the center of the screen of these given sizes, in pixels.
#
# Generally 256x256 works well across most resolutions, although very high res (4K+) may need a bigger box.
# Effect: Controls the search region size; larger boxes find targets across more of the screen but increase CPU cost and risk distractions.
box_width=128
box_height=128

# Divides the box width/height by this value to use as a maximum possible aim snap.
# Effect: Limits snap distance relative to box size; lower divisors permit longer flicks, higher divisors constrain movement to closer targets.
max_snap_divisor=2

# The RGB hex color codes to use as a basis to aim at.
#
# You should prefer magenta since it is a unique color not often used.
# Effect: Defines the palette the detector locks onto; adjusting these will change which highlights the bot can track.

# The amount of tolerance for the difference between the target color and the scanned screen color.
#
# Increasing this tolerance may provide faster and more accuracy while aiming, however going too far
# will result in more false positives!
# Effect: Widens or tightens color matching; higher tolerances accept more shades (and noise), lower tolerances require precise color matches.
target_color_tolerance=19

# Checks if window title contains this.
# Usually you want this set to "Overwatch".
#
# If you are color blocked (error 5), you can use
# "Fullscreen Projector" in OBS and here.
# Effect: Restricts input capture to windows matching this text to avoid moving the mouse when the game is not focused.
window_title_search=Overwatch

# The native mouse device ID, usually this should be 11.
# The range is 11..20 for mouse IDs.
# Effect: Selects which input device events are issued through; set to your actual mouse ID to ensure movement applies to the correct hardware.
mouse_id=11

# The native keyboard device ID, usually this should be 1.
# The range is 1..10 for keyboard IDs.
# Effect: Chooses which keyboard device the bot sends key presses to; must match your system's keyboard for toggles and clicks to register.
keyboard_id=1

# The offset in pixels to calculate the delta from.
# This number is specified for 1440p and automatically will scale with your screen resolution.
#
# You can try playing around with this to change where to aim, like moving the y down to do bodyshots.
# Effect: Shifts the aim anchor relative to screen center; tweak to bias shots toward head or body depending on hero and preference.
aim_offset_x=1.1083
aim_offset_y=0.93

# Maximum pixel distance to target to shoot when flicking.
# Setting this too high may cause it to shoot prematurely and miss,
# setting this too low may cause it to never shoot.
# Effect: Sets the acceptance radius for firing after a flick; shrink for precise hits, expand for more permissive but riskier shots.
flick_shoot_pixels=5

# Number of consecutive frames the aim must remain within the flick radius
# before clicking to help avoid accidental shots.
# Effect: Demands stability before firing; higher values reduce misfires but add latency, lower values fire faster with less confirmation.
flick_stability_frames=2

# Smoothing factor (0..1) for flick readiness. Higher values smooth more
# aggressively to avoid jitter at the cost of slower response.
# Effect: Controls exponential smoothing of flick readiness; raise to calm noisy aim signals, lower to react instantly at the expense of jitter.
flick_readiness_alpha=0.6

# Time off between flick shots (200 for McCree, 350 for Ashe, 270 for Widow)
# Effect: Enforces a cooldown between flick-triggered shots; increase to prevent double-firing, decrease for faster follow-up attempts.
flick_pause_duration=200

# Whether or not to toggle in-game UI for better accuracy when holding the aim key.
# Effect: If enabled, automatically hides the UI while aiming to reduce visual noise and potential detection errors.
toggle_in_game_ui=true

# The virtual key codes to send in order to toggle in-game UI.
# By default this is ALT (0x12) and Z (0x5A)
#
# These codes are hexadecimal.
# Effect: Defines which keys the bot presses to toggle UI; adjust if your game bindings differ.
toggle_key_codes=12,5A

# The aim precise sleeper type.
# 0 = YIELD: Balance between low-jitter and accuracy, with balanced CPU usage cost
# 1 = SPIN_WAIT: Lowest jitter and highest accuracy, but uses high CPU usage
# 2 = SLEEP: High jitter with low accuracy, but uses low CPU usage
# Effect: Chooses the sleep strategy for timing aim updates, trading CPU usage for motion smoothness and latency.
aim_precise_sleeper_type=1

# The CPU thread affinity to bind the aim thread to.
# This is an index, so it starts at 0. A 4-core CPU with hyper-threading/SMT will have IDs 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7
#
# For performance, if your CPU has hyper-threading/SMT enabled, only assign this number to even values, as these
# are the values of physical cores, rather than the hyper-thread/SMT which are virtual.
#
# DO NOT assign this to 0, as that is likely the master CPU thread used by most processes, and will probably lower your
# in-game FPS substantially.
#
# Try to pick a value as high as possible that isn't on a virtual (hyper-threading/SMT) core.
# So for a 4-core system with hyper-threading/SMT, the ideal value would be 6.
#
# Assign to -1 to disable CPU thread affinity.
#
# Recommended to DISABLE if you have less than 4 cores, as this completely locks one core
# from all other processes to be used by the aim thread.
# Effect: Pins the aim thread to a specific CPU core to reduce scheduling jitter; disabling leaves the OS free to balance load at the cost of potential timing variance.
aim_cpu_thread_affinity_index=-1
